/**
 * Timer demonstration: Output a 1Hz toggle on/off signal
 * on PA0.
 *
 * To achieve the alternating 1Hz signal on PA0 (TIM2_CH1)
 * we first set up Timer2 to tick at 10kHz with its auto-
 * reload register set to 9999. It will take 2 seconds
 * for the timer to tick up to 9999 at which point it
 * will reset back to zero.
 *
 * We configure the channel 1 compare value to be 9999
 * with an action of "toggle" and we enable GPIO output
 * for channel 1 on its default port of PA0.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103ZET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
