/**
 * USART test: asynchronous sending and receiving data
 * using interrupts
 *
 * This example will receive 5 characters on USART1 and
 * then immediately echo them back. Connect an RS232
 * cable from USART1 to your PC and run a terminal
 * program (there are many free terminal programs) to
 * see the data. The default (unremapped) USART1 pins
 * are used.
 *
 * We use interrupts to send and receive the data. The
 * hardware raises a TXE interrupt when it's ready to
 * send a character and an RXNE interrupt when data is
 * ready to receive.
 *
 * Note that if you are using the STM32F4DISCOVERY board
 * then you cannot use Usart1 since the pins clash with
 * onboard peripherals. I have tested this code on that
 * board using Usart2.
 *
 * The protocol is 57600/8/N/1
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103VET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
