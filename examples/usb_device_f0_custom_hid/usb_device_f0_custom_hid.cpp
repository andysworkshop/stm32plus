/**
 * This example demonstrates a custom 'Human Interface Device' (HID). Two neat things about
 * HID devices is that they don't need drivers on the host OS and there's no requirement for
 * them to interface with anything human at all. You can simply use them as useful bi-directional
 * interrupt driven communications channel if you want, and that's what we'll do in this
 * example.
 *
 * As long as there are no errors then this device will send an 11-byte report to the host
 * every second. The 11-bytes are, predictably, "Hello World". It will also listen for a 9-byte
 * report from the host. If it receives these 9 bytes: "stm32plus" then it will light a LED
 * on PB1 for 500ms. Change the LED port to something different if you have a board with
 * a LED on a different pin.
 *
 * Important! The SetSysClock() function in system/f042_48_8/System.c has been modified to set
 * up the system clock from the HSI48 USB clock and to trim it from SOF frames received from
 * the host. It also remaps PA11 and PA12 to PA9-10 for use by USB.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F0
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F042F6P6
