/**
 * CRC demo. This demo will show how to calculate the
 * 32-bit CRC of a stream of bytes using the hardware
 * CRC peripheral on the STM32. The calculated CRC
 * will be output to USART1. USART1 is configured as
 * 57600-8-N-1.
 *
 * Usart1 (non-remapped) is not available on the
 * STM32F4DISCOVERY. If this is your target board then
 * choose a remapped pin set or move to another usart,
 * e.g. Usart2.
 *
 * The STM32 CRC peripheral operates on 32-bit words
 * with considerations for the endian-ness of the data
 * left to the user. stm32plus provides implementations
 * for little and big endian calculations with
 * customisable padding bytes for when your data stream
 * isn't a multiple of 32-bits long.
 *
 * Big endian mode:
 *   The words are bit-reversed before going to the CRC
 *   unit and the result is bit-reversed before
 *   returning to you.
 *
 * Little endian mode:
 *   No transformations at all are performed on the
 *   data.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103ZET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
