/**
 * Semihosting is the useful ability to send debug strings to the host's console using the
 * STLink SWD debugger protocol. To use it with stm32plus ensure that you define SEMIHOSTING
 * (see above) and ensure that your OpenOCD debugger startup options include:
 *
 *   monitor arm semihosting enable
 *
 * If you fail to include the above line then you'll hit a breakpoint in the semihosting
 * implementation code at runtime.
 *
 * This example adds semihosting capabilities to the 'blink' example. It is the most basic
 * example that uses GPIO and the Systick timer to blink a LED on PC8 at 1Hz. PC8 is wired
 * to the blue onboard LED on the F1VL and F0 discovery boards.
 *
 * If the STM32F4DISCOVERY board is your target then change LED_PIN to 13 and the GPIO
 * declation to...
 *
 *  GpioD<DefaultDigitalOutputFeature<LED_PIN> > pd
 *
 * ... and change 2 of "pd[LED_PIN]" to "pd[LED_PIN]" to blink the orange led on the
 * discovery board.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F0
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F030R8T6
 *   STM32F051R8T6
 *   STM32F100RBT6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
