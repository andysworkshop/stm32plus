/**
 * USART test: synchronous receiving data
 *
 * This example will receive 5 characters from the PC
 * over USART1 using the DMA channel and then
 * immediately echo them back, also using the DMA
 * channel.
 *
 * Connect an RS232 cable from USART1 to your PC and
 * run a terminal program (there are many free terminal
 * programs) and type 5 characters into it. Those 5
 * characters will be echo'd back to the terminal.
 *
 * Note that if you are using the STM32F4DISCOVERY board
 * then you cannot use Usart1 since the pins clash with
 * onboard peripherals. I have tested this code on that
 * board using Usart2.
 *
 * The protocol is 57600/8/N/1
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103VET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
