/**
 * Timer demonstration: This demo uses the advanced control timer Timer1 to do something
 * not very advanced at all. We set the timer to count up and down, basically it oscillates
 * between 0 and 5000 at 1Khz. Each time one of the limits is hit the system raises an
 * 'Update' interrupt. We handle this interrupt by toggling a LED on PF6. The net result
 * of this is that the LED flashes on and off for a second in each of those states.
 *
 * If you are running this on the STM32F4DISCOVERY board then you can replace all reference
 * to PF6 with PD13 to use the onboard LED on that board.
 *
 * If you are running this on the VL or F0 DISCOVERY boards then you can replace all reference
 * to PF6 with PC8 to use the onboard LED on that board.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F0
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F042F6P6
 *   STM32F051R8T6
 *   STM32F100RBT6
 *   STM32F103ZET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
