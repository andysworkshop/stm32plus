/**
 * USART test: asynchronous sending multiple sequences of
 * data using DMA to transfer it and using DMA interrupts
 * to move through the sequence of data items to transfer
 *
 * This example will send the first few words from the
 * famous Lorem Ipsum quotation using USART1. Connect an
 * RS232 cable from USART1 to your PC and run a terminal
 * program (there are many free terminal programs) to see
 * the data. The default (unremapped) USART1 pins are used.
 *
 * The DMA channel associated with USART1 Tx is set up and
 * triggered. When the first transfer is complete an
 * interrupt fires and we use to initiate the next
 * transfer. When all transfers are complete we lock up.
 *
 * Note that if you are using the STM32F4DISCOVERY board
 * then you cannot use Usart1 since the pins clash with
 * onboard peripherals. I have tested this code on that
 * board using Usart2.
 *
 * The protocol is 57600/8/N/1
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 *   STM32F1
 *   STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103VET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
