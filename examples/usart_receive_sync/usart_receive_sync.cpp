/**
 * USART test: synchronous receiving data
 *
 * This example will receive 5 characters from the PC
 * over USART1 and then immediately echo them back.
 * Connect an RS232 cable from USART1 to your PC and
 * run a terminal program (there are many free terminal
 * programs) and type 5 characters into it. Those
 * 5 characters will be echo'd back to the terminal.
 *
 * Note that if you are using the STM32F4DISCOVERY
 * board then you cannot use Usart1 since the pins
 * clash with onboard peripherals. I have tested
 * this code on that board using Usart2 and Uart4.
 *
 * The protocol is 57600/8/N/1
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 * 	 STM32F1
 * 	 STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103VET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
