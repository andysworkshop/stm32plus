/**
 * Timer demonstration: Output a 1Hz toggle on/off signal
 * on PA0 and another 1Hz signal 500ms ahead of the first
 * one, output on PA1.
 *
 * The timer is configured to tick at 4000Hz with an auto-
 * reload value of 3999. Channel 1 is configured to output
 * an alternating signal on PA0 when the counter reaches
 * 3999. Similarly, channel 2 is configured to output an
 * alternating signal on PA1 when the counter reaches 1000.
 *
 * We configure the channel 1 compare value to be 3999
 * with an action of "toggle" and we enable GPIO output
 * for channel 1 on its default port of PA0.
 *
 * Compatible MCU:
 * 	 STM32F1
 * 	 STM32F4
 *
 * Tested on devices:
 *   STM32F103ZET6
 *   STM32F407VGT6
