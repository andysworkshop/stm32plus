   * Class to measure the frequency of the LSI using its output into channel 4
   * of Timer5. Of course this method fundamentally relies on the accuracy of the
   * oscillator (probably HSE) being better than that of the LSI itself.
   *
   * As an observation, the LSI on my STM32F4DISCOVERY board was measured at about 37.4kHz,
   * way off the target of 32.768kHz. This led to the clock running about 5 seconds fast per
   * minute. Using this class as the provider of the LSI frequency successfully calibrated
   * the LSI and got me an accurate RTC 1Hz tick.
