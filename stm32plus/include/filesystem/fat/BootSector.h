This is the reason that the indicated string, "MSWIN4.1", is the recommended setting, because it is the setting least likely to cause compatibility problems. If you want to put something else in here, that is your option, but the result may be that some FAT drivers might not recognize the volume. Typically this is some indication of what system formatted the volume.

There is a misconception that values greater than this are OK. Values that cause a cluster size greater than 32K bytes do not work properly; do not try to define one. Some versions of some systems allow 64K bytes per cluster value. Many application setup programs will not work correctly on such a FAT volume.
