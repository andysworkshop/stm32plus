	 * Generic template implementation of the CRC peripheral.
	 *
	 * The CRC unit operates on 32 bit words and you are most likely to be operating on
	 * a byte stream, hence this class takes bytes as input.
	 *
	 * reset() is called on construction and you can call it whenever afterwards. You then
	 * call addNewData() as many times as you have bytes to use and then call finish to
	 * flush any remaining bytes (with configurable padding). Both finish() and addNewData()
	 * return the current CRC value. The only valid method call after finish() has been
	 * called is reset()
