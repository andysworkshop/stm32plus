//   "It is crucial that the amount of growth is proportional to the current capacity(),
//    rather than a fixed constant: in the former case inserting a series of elements
//    into a vector is a linear time operation, and in the latter case it is quadratic."

// The default here on the stm32 is to assume that memory is scarce.
