     *
     * A touch screen is a resistive or capacitative controller that allows the user to interact with
     * a display by touching it. Feedback to the MCU may be via polling or asynchronous modes. The TouchScreen
     * class is independent of the resolution of both the touch panel and the underlying display. That knowledge,
     * if required, is managed by the calibration system.
