In this folder (the "extra" folder), various implementations of the
LZG decompression routine are availble.


FILES
-----

lzgmini.c
    A minimal (easy to read / not optimized for speed) implementation of the
    decoder in C. This can serve as a reference implementation for translating
    the LZG decoder to other programming languages.

lzgmini.js
    A JavaScript implementation of the LZG decoder.

lzgmini.lua
    A Lua implementation of the LZG decoder.

lzgmini.pas
    A Pascal implementation of the LZG decoder.

lzgmini_68k.s / lzgmini_68k.h
    An assembler implementation of the LZG decoder for the MC68000 family of
    16/32-bit processors.

lzgmini_6502.s
    An assembler implementation of the LZG decoder for the 6502 family of
    8-bit processors (6502/65C02/6510/8500/8502 etc).
